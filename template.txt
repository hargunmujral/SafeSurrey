The main idea is to create a bot that can scan the headlines of each new news article from a certain website
(ie Guardian, Surrey Now-Leader, etc), and IF it contains characters from the following keywords set:
    ["shoot", "stab", "shot", "kill", "threaten", "gun"]
(this would include permutations of the words, ie shooting, killed, guns, etc), then the bot would send
an alert in its specified discord channel. This should theoretically be an automated process, whereby it is
hosted on a server and is constantly pinged to check if there are new articles in the news website (perhaps
scraping off of a website that contains a catalogue of the headlines updating live), and process the headline 
to check for these keywords. In the case that none are present, we ignore the news article. In the case that 
keyword(s) are present, we want to post a message in the Discord and embed the link. Many other features can be added
but this is the high level overview of the bot's function.
